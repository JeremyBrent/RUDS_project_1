## Limiations
	- Datasets from "Women's employment" and "Hunger" had overlapping data which 	
	made it difficult to interpret. There was also a lot of data for the 
	topics so I did not add all of the datasets for these topics. 
	If we decide we want to work with these 'themes' we will need to 
	decide specifically what data we want to work with. 
	
## Data left out
	- World bank data @ https://data.worldbank.org/ . Was too much content for me 
	to decide what data we could use. Potential for using API through this link. 
	Note we do have data from the World Bank in Health Systems.
	- World Health Organization @ https://www.who.int/
