## Project 1: "All work and no play makes for unhappy nations"

## Navigating Kasia’s Notebook: 

# Questions: 
In these two sub-question, we seek to answer the following questions: 
1) Does working more make us less happy? 
2) Is there a correlation between working hours and amount of alcohol consumed?

# Data: 
Happiness vs. Annual Working Hours 
-- First file focuses on all overlapping countries between the two subsets for 2017 (kasia-happy-all.ipynb)
-- Second file contains representative countries chosen by that group for 2017  (kasia-happy.ipynb)
-- Each notebook contains additional analyses included for other factors outside of working hours that could correlate to happiness 

Amount of Alcohol Consumed vs. Annual Working Hours 
-- First file focuses on all overlapping countries between the two subsets for 2016: analysis done for combined sex, males only, females only (kasia-alcohol-all.ipynb) 
-- Second file contains representative countries chosen by that group for 2016: analysis done for combined sex, males only, females only (kasia-alcohol.ipynb)

Tools: 
-- All analyses were done in Jupyter Notebook using pandas and matplotlib  

# General Conclusions
-- Happiness decreases the more hours we work 
-- Alcohol and working hours have no strong correlation 
-- However, males drink consistently more than females all over the world 
-- Specific stats are described in depth within the Notebook’s Read Me
