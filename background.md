# RUDS_project_1: "All work and no play makes for unhappy nations"

## Motivation behind the project: 
- Coronavirus has changed the relationship of nearly all individuals to how they work. We have personally noticed a change in working hours, either working more or less, we wanted to understand the relationship between working hours and different metrics of success. So we ask, what effect does work play in the lives of individuals and the economic success of nations?

###  Working Hours:
1) Have annual working hours changed over time?
2) What is the relationship of work hours to happiness?
3) Do people who work more have more substance abuse issues? Drink more?
4) What is the relationship between working hours and productivity? GDP?

## Limitations
1) Data availability 
2) Project scope/personal skill limitations
3) Data source limitations (cantril ladder, productivity)
4) Correlation != causation
5) Specifics: "GDP vs. Satisfaction" is not complete data but it does contain 6408 records for GDP and 1705 for life satisfaction. Was getting "loss of data" warning becuase of csv/excel formatting.
