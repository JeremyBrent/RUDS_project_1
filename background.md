# RUDS_project_1: "All work and no play makes for unhappy nations"

## Motivation behind the project: 
- Coronavirus has changed the relationship of nearly all individuals to how they work. We have personally noticed a change in working hours, either working more or less, we wanted to understand the relationship between working hours and different metrics of success. So we ask, what effect does work play in the lives of individuals and the economic success of nations?

## Questions:
### Working Hours
1. Have the annual hours worked changed over the past 70 years for our representative nations?
### Happiness
2. Does working more make us less happy?
3. What is the average Cantril Happiness Scores for the chosen countries?
4. What is the average World Happiness Report Scores for the chosen countries?
5. How has Cantril Happiness Scores changed over time?
6. What is the relationship between Cantril Happiness Scores and Working hours?
### Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders
7. What is the relationship between Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders and Working hours?
8. Is there a correlation between working hours and amount of alcohol consumed?
9. What is the prevelance of mental health and substance use disorders for the chosen countries?
### GDP
10. Is there a correlation between GDP per Capita and the overall happiness of a country?
11. What is the relationship between annual working hours and national GDP?
12. What is the relationship between annual working hours and productivity?
13. What is the correlation between all of the variables we looked at?

## Limitations
1. Data availability 
2. Project scope/personal skill limitations
3. Data source limitations (cantril ladder, productivity)
4. Correlation != causation
5. Specifics: "GDP vs. Satisfaction" is not complete data but it does contain 6408 records for GDP and 1705 for life satisfaction. Was getting "loss of data" warning becuase of csv/excel formatting.
