# Questions:

In this sub-question, we seek to answer the following questions: 
1.	Is there a correlation between GDP per Capita and the overall happiness of a country?

# Data:

GDP vs. Happiness (Life satisfaction, Cantril Ladder 0-10) – Cleaned up data some more to make it usable for my analysis. Removing unneeded columns and setting fields to numeric all in my jupyter notebook (GDP_vs_Happiness.ipynb). 

1st Analysis - First I set off to find the countries that had the highest and lowest happiness ratings. From there I plotted both in one graph to visually determine if GDP plays a part in happiness levels.

2nd Analysis – I then gathered all the countries from the entire dataset and plotted them to also check if the same applied from my 1st analysis. 
Tools: -- All analysis were done in Jupyter Notebook using pandas and matplotlib

# Conclusions:

From my 1st and 2nd analysis using this dataset we can determine that there is a correlation between GDP and happiness. 

Countries with higher happiness scores showed an increase in GDP over time.

Counties with lower happiness scores showed a decline in GDP over time.
