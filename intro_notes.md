## Limiations
- Datasets from "Women's employment" and "Hunger" had overlapping data which 	
   made it difficult to interpret. There was also a lot of data for the 
   topics so I did not add all of the datasets for these topics. 
   If we decide we want to work with these 'themes' we will need to 
   decide specifically what data we want to work with and if we need to get the data that was left behind. 
- "World Development Indicators" seemed like it would difficult data to use to do what we need to do; alot of the data was text data. I'm down to use it, it looked interesting, but we should discuss that as a group. 
- "GDP vs. Satisfaction" is not complete data but it does contain 6408 records for GDP and 1705 for life satisfaction.  Was getting "loss of data" warning becuase of csv/excel formatting. Did some reserach, did find anything. People seemed to think it was a bug. A second pair of eyes on this would be appreciate. For this dataset, if we agree to use it, we will  to decide as a group what we should do with this data. 
	
## Data left out
- World bank data @ https://data.worldbank.org/ . Was too much content for me 
   to decide what data we could use. Potential for using API through this link. 
   Note we do have data from the World Bank in Health Systems.
- World Health Organization @ https://www.who.int/
- http://datatopics.worldbank.org/jobs/ .... This link has a lot of data, and I can only seem to download one country at a time. I did not put the dataset into the repo because I think we should decide as a group if this is relevant and if so, what countries should we get. 
- https://datahub.io/collections/economic-data .... Same situation as the previous bullet point. 
- https://www.bls.gov/data/ ... Same situation as the previous two bullet points.
